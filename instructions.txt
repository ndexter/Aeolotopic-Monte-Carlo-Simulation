The main program is monte_carlo.c, it is written to be compiled with the GNU C++ Compiler, g++. Before compiling, ensure that you have installed the GNU Scientific Library and that it is in your build path. Note: monte_carlo.c is written in C, but uses a C++ library and needs to be compiled with g++.

To compile the code:
g++ monte_carlo.c -fopenmp -lgsl -lgslcblas -arch i386

To compile with debugging enabled:
g++ monte_carlo.c -fopenmp -lgsl -lgslcblas -arch i386 -ggdb

To run the code in the terminal on OSX or Linux:
./a.out

To run the code in cygwin on Windows:
./a.exe

To run the code in debugging mode, after compiling with debugging enabled on Linux or OSX use:
gdb a.out 

To run the code in debugging mode, after compiling with debugging enabled on Windows:
gdb a.exe

The plot.plt file is a gnuplot script for automatically generating plots in the postscript file format. To use the script, you must have gnuplot installed.
